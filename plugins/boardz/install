ETL for Moodle
***********************************

ETL for moodle provides a standard and generic way to export documented data extraction to an external
analysis software.

ETL is a report and has some subplugins for adapting the output to each external LRS recorder. This is
not natively supported by moodle but needs a very little change in a core library to allow subplugins support:

in /lib/classes/component.php,

replace line 48 with :

    protected static $supportsubplugins = array('mod', 'editor', 'tool', 'local', 'report');

this should be done BEFORE plugin installation so subplugins setup can be run at install time.
