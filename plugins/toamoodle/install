TOA for Moodle
***********************************

TOA for Moodle is a powerful Data analysis application
using state of the art "Business Intelligence" technologies
for analysing activity of a Moodle platform.

I provides a complete ETL (Etractino Transform and Load) process
using Pentaho open source components, stores datawarehouse in a MySQL
dataase, and provides a complete Web based Report manager and
configurator.

TOA for Moodle applications runs on J2EE platforms on TomCat, and is provided
as a full installable suite.

This installer refers only to the Moodle side installation of the ETL extraction
infrastructure.

The install process is very simple, and needs a three point very small customization
in order for administration reports to accept a sub-plugins structure.

The ETL customization has been carefully checked for needing a minimal footprint
in the core so upgrade will be very easy to ensure.

Insert point 1 : 

in lib/locallib.php, anywhere, add the include for additional localization functions

// PATCH : Integrating reports subplugins
include $CFG->libdir.'/localreportslib.php';
// \PATCH

Insert point 2 : 

Add the localreportslib.php in lib

Insert point 3 : in order to allow administration upgrade discover the report sub plugins,
patch the admin/index.php around line 490 (sequence of upgrade calls). The patch is non disruptive
in case of incomplete integration.

/// PATCH Reports subplugins
/// get sub plugins in reports
    if (function_exists('upgrade_report_plugins')){
        upgrade_report_plugins("$CFG->wwwroot/$CFG->admin/index.php");  // Return here afterwards
    }
/// \\PATCH Report sub plugins
